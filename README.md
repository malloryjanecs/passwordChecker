# passwordChecker
Check password for data breach exposure

This script uses the HAVEIBEENPWNED API to check password exposure.
Using the text file to check passwords ensures the password isn't logged in the command line.

<b>Steps</b>
<ul class="use">
  <li>Download the repository</li>
  <li>Open the passwords.txt file and enter character combinations on different lines</li>
  <li>Open the terminal</li>
  <li>Navigate to the repository's working directory</li>
  <li>Run the program from the command line:</li>
  <ul class="run-file">
    <li>python3 checkmypass.py passwords.txt</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

The result for each character combination will appear in the terminal.

Thank you,
